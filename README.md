üìä Financial Statement Analysis Using Pythonüêç

In this project, I leveraged several powerful libraries, including:

- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis

- NumPy for numerical operations

- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

- WordCloud for visual representation of frequently occurring terms

Key Highlights:

- Top 5 Payments: Identified the largest payments made over the analysis period

- Monthly Income & Expenses Analysis: Visualized income and expenses trends on a monthly basis

- Average Monthly Expenses: Calculated to understand spending patterns

- Average Monthly Savings: Analyzed savings to track financial progress

- Word Cloud: Created a word cloud to highlight the most common transaction descriptions

- Various Charts: Utilized different types of charts to represent data clearly and effectively

This project has enhanced my understanding of my financial habits and helped me gain deeper insights through data-driven analysis.
